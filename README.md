# Prediction-of-acoustic-instabities-in-Rijke-Tube-with-Machine-Learning
Acoustic Instabilities in Rijke Tube are predicted using the dataset obtained from the Rijke Tube experiment.
Several machine learning methods are used to predict the stable and unstable state of the system.
Regression methods, K means Clustering and logistic regression are used for the system state prediction and to see how accurately the model predicts the state of the system.
Neural network model is also used for the system state prediction.
NN model is developed from scratch(only using numpy) as well as using libraries.
